# CART

Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are one implementation of Decision Trees.
The non-terminal nodes of Classification and Regression Trees are the root node and the internal node.
The terminal nodes are the leaf nodes. Each non-terminal node represents a single input variable (x) and a splitting point on that variable;
the leaf nodes represent the output variable (y). The model is used as follows to make predictions:
walk the splits of the tree to arrive at a leaf node and output the value present at the leaf node.
