# Random Forest Algorithm

## Why is it used ?
1. It takes less training time as compared to other algorithms.
2. It predicts output with high accuracy, even for the large dataset it runs efficiently.
3. It can also maintain accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing.

## Applications :-

## There are mainly four sectors where Random forest mostly used:
1. Banking: Banking sector mostly uses this algorithm for the identification of loan risk.
2. Medicine: With the help of this algorithm, disease trends and risks of the disease can be identified.
3. Land Use: We can identify the areas of similar land use by this algorithm.
4. Marketing: Marketing trends can be identified using this algorithm.

## Advantages:-
1. Random Forest is capable of performing both Classification and Regression tasks.
2. It is capable of handling large datasets with high dimensionality.
3. It enhances the accuracy of the model and prevents the overfitting issue.

## Disadvantages :-
1. Although random forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks, it is not more suitable for Regression tasks.

## Implementation Steps :-

1. Data Pre-processing step
2. Fitting the Random forest algorithm to the Training set
3. Predicting the test result
4. Test accuracy of the result (Creation of Confusion matrix)
5. Visualizing the test set result.
